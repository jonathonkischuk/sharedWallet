# sharedWallet
This is a shared wallet.

It is meant to give the functionality of a contract owner (i.e. buis owner or parent) who can assign assets 
to a number of other wallets (i.e. employees or children).

It allows you to send money, allocate as you see fit (i.e. travel per diem or allowance) to other wallets,
it allows other wallets to withdraw funds within their balance range, and has checks and balances in place to avoid bad actors or mistakes.

It also keeps track of who the contract owner is, as they have added access.
